# Clustering-of-Amazon-products
This is a project related to the context of ADM (Algorithms for Data Mining) Homework 4, Data Science Course in "UniversitÃ  La Sapienza".
Topics: ML Algorithms, Clustering, NLP, Data Analysis

*************************
### Goal
The purpose of this project is to play with a dataset gathering reviews (~560k) of fine foods from Amazon. The reviews include much information. We focus on the reviews' plain text and try to cluster the products (~74k), by K-Means algorithm, implemented from scratch and not.

### Get data to analyze
The data have been taken from this Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews). They have been cleaned, processed and analyzed with NLP's toolkit.

## Files descriptions
The directory of this homework consists of one file:

1 `clustering.ipynb`
> This Jupyter notebook file contains all the functions and  the descriptive process to pre-process the data and apply ML algorithms, with the analysis of results.
